# wireframing
##  Introduction to Wireframing  
Wireframing is a foundational step in the design process that involves creating simplified visual representations of a user interface. These low-fidelity sketches or digital layouts focus on structure, functionality, and user flow—without getting caught up in colors, fonts, or final visuals.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders align on layout decisions early in the project lifecycle. They act as blueprints for the user experience, allowing teams to test ideas, identify usability issues, and iterate quickly before investing in high-fidelity design or development.

##  Why Wireframing Matters  
- **Clarifies layout and navigation before design begins**  
- **Facilitates communication between designers, developers, and clients**  
- **Helps identify potential UX issues early**  
- **Saves time and resources by reducing rework**  
- **Supports user-centered design by focusing on functionality first**

This repository will explore wireframing techniques, tools, and examples—especially as they apply to front-end development and human-centric design.
